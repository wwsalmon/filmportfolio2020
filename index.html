                    <h2>John’s Plan: Parody Music Video</h2>
                    <p>Parody of Drake’s “God’s Plan,” with lyrics written by members of Andover’s comedy group Under The Bed, made for the
                    annual comedy show Andover Night Live in May 2018. The video was the highlight of the show, hitting 1000 views within
                    two days of being uploaded on YouTube. We took it down afterwards because we really do love our Head of School (“John”),
                    and as fun as it was to poke fun at some of his less successful policies, we didn’t want our video to be misinterpreted
                    by those outside of our community and cause him harm.</p>
                    <p>I mixed the audio for the parody track and also directed, filmed, and edited the video. The video took inspiration from
                    Drake’s original music video, adding new ideas related to the lyrics and a dance performance by student hip-hop group
                    Hypnotiq. The video was shot on a Sony A6500, with the added challenge of only using a 35mm (50mm with APS-C crop) prime
                    lens for the entire shoot. Audio was mixed in Logic Pro X, and video was edited in Premiere Pro.</p>

                    <h2>Severance: 24-hour “Flash Film”</h2>
                    <p>A 5-minute short film about a student with a helpful, or maybe not, voice in his head. The film was made entirely in a 24 hour timespan at an overnight filmmaking event. Starting at 8PM, a friend and I wrote the script. The next morning, we shot everything, with me serving as director and cinematographer; I spent the afternoon editing, and at 8PM that night, 24 hours after the start of the event, the film was screened. Shot on a Sony A6500 with a 16-70mm and 35mm prime and edited in Premiere Pro. Also used Zoom H1 for audio and several lights.</p>

                    <h2>Cyclist: 30 Second Short Film</h2>
                    <p>A 30-second short film I shot and edited in April 2018. As a member of Andover’s cycling team, I wanted to capture the
                    thrill of racing alongside the monotony of sitting on a trainer for an hour. I used sound design and lots of quick close
                    ups to tie together race footage and create a fast-paced narrative. Shot on my A6500 with a 35mm prime and edited in
                    Premiere Pro.</p>

                    <h2>The Stories of Grasshopper 2018, Mini-Doc</h2>
                    <p>A 5-minute excerpt of a 12-minute mini-doc about the 2018 Grasshopper Talent Show, made for Phillipian Video. I shot
                    interviews and extensive rehearsal/backstage footage on a Sony A6500 with a 35mm prime, with audio recorded on a Zoom
                    H1, and edited the video in Premiere Pro. The edit also makes use of the full show recording by Andover’s A/V
                    department.</p>

                    <p>One video in a series of videos made for Andover’s Admissions department, sent out to all newly accepted students in
                    March 2018. I made all motion graphics in After Effects, shot the interviews and most of the b-roll, and edited the
                    video in Premiere Pro, with some specific clips from other students and clubs.</p>

            <h2>Additional Information</h2>
            <p>My entrypoint to videography and filmmaking was through tech videos on YouTube. I obsessively watched reviews of phones,
            laptops, and other gadgets, then made my own. With an old camcorder and free trials of editing software, I tried to
            replicate what I saw online, with each video adding something new: video a-roll instead of just voiceover, color
            grading, motion graphics.</p>
            
            <p>Learning to make tech videos, I watched and read a lot of filmmaking tutorials and case studies. I learned how to
            properly expose shots, how to use J-cuts and L-cuts, and about different kinds of cameras, lenses, and equipment; these
            were skills that I immediately applied to my tech videos. But I also found myself drawn to topics like blocking,
            motivated camera movements, story structure, character development, and edit pacing. Watching hours of behind-the-scenes
            and film breakdowns, I became enthralled by narrative filmmaking, especially low-budget indie filmmaking. With the most
            minimal of people, gear, locations, and even time, indie filmmakers crafted entire worlds and intricate storylines.
            Every step of the way involved endless creative problem solving: continuously tweaking scripts and storyboards in
            pre-production; rewriting scenes and dialogue during production when actors or locations drop out; in post, finally
            putting everything together, forming a (hopefully) beautiful tapestry out of loose pieces.</p>
            
            <p>In my ninth grade biology class, my teacher assigned short films as final projects, and I couldn’t have been happier.
            The first final was my first narrative short film, my first chance to actually apply all that I had learned. “How many
            cameras did you have rolling?” A classmate asked when watching our film later. One, plus skillful blocking and editing!
            The film was rough and took a lot of time to make, but gave me a valuable hands-on foundations in scriptwriting,
            directing, cinematography, and editing.</p>
            
            <p>For the spring final, I went all out. My script was 38 pages, with a chase scene, kidnapping, and leap off of a cliff.
            It was carefully written around my friends, who would be my actors, my school, and the park across the street. I
            meticulously planned a 5-day shooting schedule, taking into account weather and availability, and storyboarded out all
            the action scenes. During shooting, things didn’t go as planned: the locations didn’t look like what I remembered,
            actors weren’t available when they said, filming was delayed or cut short; but I was expecting this. Making on-the-spot
            creative changes felt natural thanks to all the directors I had watched do the same, and production moved along
            steadily. The last big challenge was story-specific: one of the characters had mind-reading abilities that at times
            overwhelmed him. In post, I used 3D motion tracking in After Effects to add visual thoughts, and used sound design in
            Premiere to sell the effect. The final film was 24 minutes long. Some aspects of it I’m proud of, some not so much — it
            was only my second-ever narrative film, after all; the real value was in the process of making it, allowing me to
            explore and push my filmmaking skills and gain experience in multiple key areas.</p>
            
            <p>sSince then, I’ve continued to explore my passion for visual storytelling and improve my filmmaking skills. At Andover, I
            was a board member of Andover Moviemakers, continuing to make short films and teaching students at workshops. My
            favorite films I made at the club’s annual “flash films” events, where an entire film is written, shot, and edited in a
            24-hour time span, recreating the thrill and ambition of my first projects. With these films I got better at coming up
            with stories, building characters, and working quickly when shooting and editing, creating a confidence I could build on
            when I had more time. A project I really enjoyed was a 30-second film about cycling, using editing and sound design to
            craft a narrative out of race and training footage. I’ve looked beyond indie filmmaking too, watching and reading lots
            of analyses of Hollywood films and interviews of their makers, and the summer before junior year I worked as a PA on a
            film set. I’ve found opportunities to apply my skills when making promotional videos for my school’s Admissions office
            and various student organizations, along with several music and dance videos. I’ve explored a new type of storytelling
            with documentary filmmaking, making mini-docs for our student paper’s Video section.</p>
            
            <p>For the past year, I’ve spent most of my energy starting a live-broadcast news show within our student paper, focusing
            on the editorial and technical aspects of live reporting and video production. Soon my tenure on the paper’s board will
            come to an end. When I get the chance to, I hope to get into more meaningful narrative and documentary filmmaking:
            narrative films that don’t just tell stories for craftsmanship, but related to more emotional themes and drawing on my
            own life and story; and documentaries of the incredible stories that unfold on Andover’s campus and in bustling NYC.</p>
            
            <p>Technical details: for the past two years I’ve shot on a Sony A6500. My favorite lens is a 35mm (50mm equivalent) prime,
            which I love for its shallow depth of field and natural focal length. I edit in Adobe Premiere Pro and do motion
            graphics and VFX work in After Effects. I’m a big believer in the idea that sound is as or more important than visuals,
            and I frequently use sound design in my work to sell the portrayal of an otherwise hard-to-believe action or object
            behavior, or just to add some more depth. I love lighting and its power to drastically alter a scene; I’ve played around
            with lighting in controlled settings, and want to explore using it more with narrative projects.</p>
